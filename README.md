<h3>You want to know more about me?</h3>
My complete name is Andres Mauricio Hernandez Serna, I am from Barranquilla, Colombia; but I am based now at Medellin, Colombia. I am currently studying electrical engineer in University of Antioquia and also becoming a web front-end developer with the University of EAFIT.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning web front end in depth, working and learning with Globant!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Innovative projects with people who contribute a lot to my formative stage, in addition to
jobs where fundamental skills of a developer are put into practice using topics that seem interesting to me.
