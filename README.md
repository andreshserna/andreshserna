- 👋 Hi, I’m @andreshserna, my name is Andres Mauricio Hernandez Serna, I am from Barranquilla, Colombia; but I am based now at
Medellin, Colombia. I am currently studying electrical engineer in University of Antioquia and also becoming a web front-end
developer with the University of Antioquia.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning web front end in depth.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Innovative projects with people who contribute a lot to my formative stage, in addition to
jobs where fundamental skills of a developer are put into practice using topics that seem interesting to me.
